About BugLogHQ
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
BugLogHQ is a tool to centralize the handling of automated bug reports from 
multiple applications. BugLogHQ provides a unified view of error messages
sent from any number of applications, allowing the developer to search,
graph, forward, and explore the bug reports submitted by the applications. 
All bug reports received by BugLogHQ are stored on a normalized database, thus 
providing the option to the developers to further extend the application
to leverage this information.



Integrating BugLogHQ into your Applications
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Applications can send bug reports to BugLogHQ via three different ways:
* webservice call
* http post
* direct CFC call

BugLogHQ provides a CFC that can be used to send the bug reports. This CFC is 
located in /bugLog/client/bugLogService.cfc. This is the only file that needs
to be distributed with any application that wants to submit reports to BugLogHQ.

You may instantiate and keep the instance of this CFC in some a scope
such as Application and then just call the "notifyService" method in it whenever
the application needs to submit a bug report.

To initialize the bugLogService, call the Init method. This method takes three
parameters:
* bugLogListener:	The location of the listener where to send the bug reports
* bugEmailRecipients:  A comma-delimited list of email addresses to which send the 
						bug reports in case there is an error submitting the report
						to the bugLog listener.
* bugEmailSender:	The sender address to use when sending the emails mentioned above.

The bugLogListener parameter can be any of:
* WSDL pointing to /bugLog/listeners/bugLogListenerWS.cfc (to submit the report using a webservice), 
* Full URL pointing to /bugLog/listeners/bugLogListenerREST.cfm (to submit as an http post)
* path to /bugLog/listeners/bugLogListenerWS.cfc in dot notation (i.e. bugLog.listeners.bugLogListenerWS)

If an error occurs while submitting the report to the listener, then bugLogService will automatically
send the same information as an email to the addresses provided in the Init() method.



BugLogHQ Interface
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
To access the BugLogHQ interface, go to /bugLog/ on your bugLog server; the interface is
password protected. The default username and password is: admin / admin.
From here you can have an overview of every bug report that has been received. Everything
is pretty self-explanatory, and there are lots of things you can click to visualize the
data in different ways.



Installation and Usage Notes:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* To install BugLog just unpack the zip file into the root of your webserver. BugLogHQ assumes it will be
installed on a directory or mapping named /bugLog.

* Run the corresponding SQL script for your database. The script can be found in the /install directory. This 
will create the necessary tables.

* By default bugLogHQ uses a datasource named "bugLog" with no password, to change this go to:
		/bugLog/components/db/DAOFactory.cfc (lines 3-5)

* To access the bugLogHQ interface, go to /bugLog. The default username/password is:
		username: admin
		password: admin
	IMPORTANT: To change the admin password, you must edit the bl_Users table directly.

* You may also want to setup proper email addresses for sending bug reports when things do not work as they should: 
		/bugLog/hq/Application.cfc (lines 13-14)
		/bugLog/hq/config/config.xml (lines 5-6)


Supported Databases:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Currently BugLogHQ supports the following databases:
* MySQL
* Microsoft SQL Server 2000
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005
